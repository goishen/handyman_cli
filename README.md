My first foray into databases.   

I followed along teclado's (youtube) channel.  He created a database for flavors, types of preparation, and a rating scale for different brands of coffee.   

I created mine with a tad more boring flair.  Created a database that you can search through either by name or zipcode (my idea).  I know you can still add junk to the database.  Hell, you should see mine.

I'm also aware of the fact that I can find() to search the database, but am unaware of how it will affect things.  I do know that it will bring back an index, though.  

But, it is almost 2:30AM here, so I'm going to bed.
