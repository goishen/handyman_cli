Second foray into databases.   Well, I finally got partial string searches working.   Woo!   After spending 2 days slamming my head into a wall.   I'm leaving all the commented stuff in there.  Maybe I'll remove it.  Maybe not.  

It might be bad for SQL injection, but I don't care.   I'm just happy that I got it working.  Besides, it's not like I work for google.  I also got the zipcode search working.   So, I'm extremely happy about that.   I'm thinking that next I'll work on getting it to work with a SMTP library, or I might see how much data a cell can hold (I know it's a lot, but exactly how much, I'm not sure).  To put in what they did for the client.

I might get a wild hair up my ass and decide to recode it in tkinter, see if I can't get that up and running.

My first foray into databases.   

I followed along teclado's (youtube) channel.  He created a database for flavors, types of preparation, and a rating scale for different brands of coffee.   

I created mine with a tad more boring flair.  Created a database that you can search through either by name or zipcode (my idea).  I know you can still add junk to the database.  Hell, you should see mine.

I'm also aware of the fact that I can find() to search the database, but am unaware of how it will affect things.  I do know that it will bring back an index, though.  

But, it is almost 2:30AM here, so I'm going to bed.
